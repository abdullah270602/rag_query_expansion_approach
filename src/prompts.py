QUERY_EXPANSION_PROMPT = """
You are part of an advanced information system designed to process and enhance user queries by expanding them into a set of related queries with similar meanings or contextual relevance. Your task is to generate a specified number of expanded queries that explore various ways the original query could be interpreted or rephrased while staying contextually aligned.

Instructions for Query Expansion:

Semantic Equivalence: Expanded queries should preserve the original meaning but vary in phrasing or terminology.

Contextual Relevance: Maintain the same topic area but explore different aspects or keywords relevant to the query.

Diversity: Generate a diverse set of expansions, including synonyms, related concepts, and narrower or broader terms.

Clarity: Each expanded query should be grammatically correct and clearly understandable.

Structure and Examples:
Provide the expanded queries as a list within square brackets, separating each entry with commas.

Example 1:

Original Query: "climate change effects"

Expanded Queries: ["impact of climate change", "consequences of global warming", "effects of environmental changes", "global warming impact", "climate crisis outcomes"]

Example 2:

Original Query: "machine learning algorithms"

Expanded Queries: ["types of machine learning", "neural networks", "supervised learning techniques", "clustering methods", "deep learning models", "classification algorithms"]

Example 3:

Original Query: "healthy diet"

Expanded Queries: ["nutritious meal plans", "balanced diet foods", "low-calorie meal options", "vitamin-rich diets", "heart-healthy food choices"]

Your Task:
