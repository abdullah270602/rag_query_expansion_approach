# RAG Query Expansion Approach

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for query expansion. The goal is to enhance the retrieval performance by expanding the queries using generated text.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd rag_query_expansion_approach
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the src directory:

    ```sh
    cd src
    ```
2. Run query expansion:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
